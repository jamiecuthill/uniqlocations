# Unique Location Engineering Challenge

Given a string is input to the application containing compass directions (NESW) the result is an integer for the number of unique locations visited. The origin (starting position) does not count as a visited location unless you revist it on your travels.

Example

The input of "NESSWWNNES" would draw this map, starting at `o` and finishing in the same position.

```plaintext

. . . . .
. x x x .
. x o x .
. x x x .
. . . . .
```

The application will return the number `9`.
